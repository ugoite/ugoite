## Milestone 1: MVP ✅

**Archive**: [archive/mvp-milestone.md](archive/mvp-milestone.md)

Delivered the foundational architecture and core features:
- Local-first storage with fsspec abstraction
- Entry CRUD with revision history and conflict detection
- Markdown-to-structured-data extraction
- Schema/Form definitions for typed entries
- SolidStart frontend + FastAPI backend

---

## Milestone 2: Full Configuration ✅

**Archive**: [archive/milestone-2-full-configuration.md](archive/milestone-2-full-configuration.md)

Focus on codebase quality, consistency, and architecture refinement:

### Key Objectives
1. **Terminology Unification** - Consolidate "datamodel", "schema", "form" to single "form" term
2. **Rust Core Library** - Extract core logic into a Rust crate for multi-platform use
3. **Feature Path Consistency** - Standardize directory structure across all modules
4. **Requirements Automation** - YAML-based requirements with automated test verification

### Deliverables
- `ugoite-core` Rust crate with opendal for storage
- Python bindings via pyo3 for ugoite-cli
- Unified feature paths in `docs/spec/features.yaml`
- YAML-based requirements in `docs/spec/requirements/`
- Document consistency tests

## Milestone 3: Markdown as Table 📋

**Tasks**: [tasks.md](tasks.md)

Focus on storing entries as Form-backed Iceberg tables while preserving the current UI behavior:

### Key Objectives
1. **Iceberg Storage** - Form-defined fields stored as Iceberg tables per Form
2. **Form-First Entries** - Entries require a Form; no formless entries
3. **Deterministic Reconstruction** - Markdown can be reconstructed from table rows
4. **Ugoite SQL** - Domain-specific SQL for flexible user queries

### Expected Deliverables
- Iceberg-backed storage in `ugoite-core`
- Form validation for allowed fields
- SQL query engine over Form data

---

## Milestone 4: User Controlled View 📋

Focus on enabling user-defined UI views driven by queries:

### Key Objectives
1. **Query + UI Composition** - Users attach UI components to queries
2. **Low-Code Views** - Views are expressed as UI-only definitions
3. **Shareable View Specs** - Views stored in the space and reusable

### Expected Deliverables
- View definition format and renderer
- Query-driven UI panels
- Saved, shareable view definitions

---

## Milestone 5: AI-Enabled & AI-Used 📋

Focus on complete AI integration and workflow automation:

### Key Objectives
1. **Full MCP Server Implementation** - Complete resource and tool exposure
2. **AI Workflow Automation** - Scheduled tasks, batch processing via AI
3. **Vector Search Integration** - FAISS index with embedding support
4. **Voice-to-Schema** - Audio upload with AI-powered transcription and structuring
5. **Computational Entries** - Embedded JavaScript execution in entries

### Expected Deliverables
- Production-ready MCP server
- Vector search with configurable embedding providers
- Voice memo asset with transcription workflow
- Interactive code block execution in editor

---

## Milestone 6: User Management 📋

Focus on multi-user support and security:

### Key Objectives
1. **Authentication** - JWT/OAuth2 support with configurable providers
2. **Authorization** - Space and entry-level permissions
3. **Multi-tenant Spaces** - Shared spaces with collaboration
4. **Audit Logging** - Track all changes with user attribution
5. **API Keys** - Service account access for automation

### Expected Deliverables
- Pluggable auth provider system
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Space sharing and invitation system
- Activity audit trail

---

## Milestone 7: Native App 📋

Focus on desktop application using Tauri:

### Key Objectives
1. **Tauri Desktop App** - Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
2. **Direct Crate Integration** - ugoite-core used directly (not via Python)
3. **Offline-First Sync** - Background sync with conflict resolution
4. **System Integration** - File associations, tray icon, keyboard shortcuts
5. **Mobile Support** - iOS/Android via Tauri Mobile (experimental)

### Expected Deliverables
- Standalone desktop application
- Local-only mode with no server dependency
- Optional cloud sync via storage connectors
- Mobile companion apps (experimental)
