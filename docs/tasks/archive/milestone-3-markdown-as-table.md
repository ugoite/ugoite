# Milestone 3: Markdown as Table

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Goal**: Store entries as Iceberg-backed tables while preserving the current UI behavior

This milestone replaces the current Markdown-based storage with an Apache Iceberg table model (official Rust crate + OpenDAL), while keeping user experience unchanged. Entries become row-based records defined by Forms, and queryable via a domain-specific SQL.

---

## Constraints (MUST)

- **No migration path required**: We do not provide any conversion from the current storage format.
- **Breaking change is acceptable**: Existing users and data are out of scope.
- **Form-first**: Entries can only be created for a defined Form. The current “formless entry” flow is removed.
- **Phase 1 UI lock**: Initial implementation must keep the UI behavior *exactly* as it is today. Only `ugoite-core` storage changes.

---

## Phase 0: Spec Alignment & Form-First Contract

**Objective**: Align specs and tests with the Iceberg-backed, Form-first model before storage changes.

### Key Tasks
- [x] Update data-model specs to describe Iceberg-backed Form tables and reconstruction rules.
- [x] Document the breaking-change/no-migration decision for Milestone 3.
- [x] Align test coverage with Form-first enforcement requirements.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Specs reflect Form-first storage and Iceberg-backed entries.
- [x] Tests reference Form-first requirements.

---

## Phase 1: Iceberg storage for form-defined fields only

**Objective**: Replace entry storage with Apache Iceberg in `ugoite-core`, limited to fields defined by the Form schema. H2 sections not in the Form are rejected.

### Key Tasks
- [x] Define Iceberg table layout and schema per Form (entries + revisions tables).
- [x] Define `forms/` as the Iceberg-managed root and document ownership rules.
- [x] Standardize Form name → Iceberg table name mapping (no form_id directories).
- [x] Update `ugoite-core` write path to persist entry records via Iceberg (official Rust crate + OpenDAL).
- [x] Update `ugoite-core` read path to reconstruct Markdown content from Iceberg fields.
- [x] Enforce “Form-defined H2 only” validation in `ugoite-core`.
- [x] Keep backend and frontend API contracts unchanged.
- [x] Add/update tests in `ugoite-core` to validate Iceberg round-trip.

### Legacy → TOBE (directory-structure) Delta
- **Remove per-entry folders**: `entries/{entry_id}/` with `meta.json`, `content.json`, and `history/` are no longer used.
- **Iceberg-managed forms root**: `forms/` is the Iceberg-managed root; Iceberg owns all subfolders and table metadata.
- **Table naming**: Form name is the Iceberg table name; no form_id directories are created.
- **Form definitions in Iceberg**: Form fields and schemas live in Iceberg; no per-form JSON files.
- **Fixed template**: Default entry template is global (`# {form_name}` with H2 columns), not per form.
- **Reconstruction source**: Markdown is reconstructed from Iceberg fields (no free-form H2 storage in Phase 1).
- **No index JSON**: `index.json` and related index files are removed from TOBE; indexes are derived from Iceberg as needed.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Entries are stored in Iceberg tables per Form.
- [x] Entries can be read back with identical Markdown content (current UI behavior preserved).
- [x] Non-Form H2 sections are rejected by `ugoite-core`.

---

## Phase 2: Optional extra attributes in Form schema

**Objective**: Allow Forms to declare whether extra attributes (non-registered H2 sections) are allowed, and how they are stored.

### Key Tasks
- [x] Extend Form definition to include `allow_extra_attributes` with options (e.g., `deny`, `allow_json`, `allow_columns`).
- [x] Update validation to enforce the new Form policy.
- [x] Implement storage for extra attributes (JSON column or dynamic columns, as specified).
- [x] Update documentation in `docs/spec/data-model/` for the new Form rules.
- [x] Add tests that cover both “deny” and “allow” modes.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Form schema can explicitly allow or deny extra attributes.
- [x] Extra attributes are stored deterministically.
- [x] Validation behavior matches the Form policy.

---

## Phase 3: Ugoite SQL (Domain-Specific SQL)

**Objective**: Define and implement an SQL dialect optimized for Ugoite forms and Iceberg storage.

### Key Tasks
- [x] Define Ugoite SQL syntax and capabilities (filter, sort, select, aggregate).
- [x] Map SQL queries to Iceberg scans in `ugoite-core`.
- [x] Add query validation and error reporting.
- [x] Integrate with existing REST/MCP query endpoints without API changes.
- [x] Add tests for SQL parsing and execution.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Users can query Form data via Ugoite SQL.
- [x] SQL execution returns consistent, deterministic results.
- [x] Query errors are clear and actionable.

---

## Phase 4: Metadata Columns, Rich Types, Link URIs, SQL Joins

**Objective**: Expand the Iceberg-backed data model with reserved metadata columns,
rich content column types with Markdown-friendly parsing, canonical Ugoite link URIs,
and broadened Ugoite SQL join capabilities.

### Key Tasks
- [x] Define metadata vs content column ownership rules and reserved names.
- [x] Prevent user-defined form fields from using metadata column names.
- [x] Make metadata column list extensible for future system-owned fields.
- [x] Expand content column types to additional Iceberg primitives (time, timestamp_tz, timestamp_ns, uuid, binary, etc.).
- [x] Update Markdown parsing to produce typed values (including bullet-list parsing for list fields).
- [x] Introduce Ugoite URI scheme for in-entry links (entry, asset, extensible kinds) and normalize links on write/read.
- [x] Extend Ugoite SQL to support richer JOIN clauses (RIGHT/FULL/CROSS, USING/NATURAL).
- [x] Update shared SQL lint/completion rules to reflect JOIN support and base tables.
- [x] Add tests for metadata column validation, rich type parsing, link URI normalization, and JOIN execution.
- [x] Update frontend UX to enforce form-first entry creation and surface form validation warnings.
- [x] Add frontend guardrails for reserved metadata column names and list-friendly field types.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Metadata columns are reserved and cannot be used as user-defined Form fields.
- [x] Content columns support expanded Iceberg types with deterministic Markdown parsing.
- [x] Ugoite link URIs are normalized and persisted consistently.
- [x] Ugoite SQL supports JOIN queries across entries, links, and assets.
- [x] Frontend entry creation is form-first, and validation feedback is visible in the editor UX.
- [x] Form creation/editing UI blocks reserved metadata column names.

---

## Phase 5: SQL Form (Metadata Form) + CRUD

**Objective**: Define and implement a system-owned SQL Form to persist SQL queries
and variables with full CRUD support, while preventing user-defined Forms from
using the reserved SQL form name.

### Key Tasks
- [x] Define the SQL Form schema as a metadata Form with reserved name protection.
- [x] Add SQL variable object-list type and validation rules in the data model spec.
- [x] Extend REST API and ugoite-core with SQL CRUD operations.
- [x] Add tests covering SQL CRUD and reserved SQL Form name rejection.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] SQL Form is system-owned; users cannot create a Form with the SQL name.
- [x] SQL records store SQL text and a list of typed variables (type, name, description).
- [x] SQL CRUD operations are available via API and core bindings.
- [x] Tests confirm reserved form name enforcement and SQL CRUD behavior.

---

## Phase 5.5: SQL Session Redesign

**Objective**: Redefine SQL session handling so it remains stateless beyond
OpenDAL storage, without relying on RDBs or external job queues.

### Key Tasks
- [x] Sessions store **metadata only** in `meta.json` (no result rows).
- [x] `create_sql` creates corresponding **materialized view metadata** under
	`spaces/{space_id}/materialized_views/`.
- [x] SQL updates/deletes synchronize materialized view metadata refresh/removal.
- [x] Session metadata stores snapshot ID and paging hints for fast re-queries.
- [x] Sessions are short-lived (target: ~10 minutes) and shareable across API servers.
- [x] Update `docs/spec` data model, API, and SQL docs to reflect the redesign.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] SQL sessions store metadata only and are re-executable.
- [x] `materialized_views/` lifecycle is synchronized with saved SQL.
- [x] Session metadata includes snapshot and paging details.
- [x] Specs in `docs/spec` are updated consistently.
