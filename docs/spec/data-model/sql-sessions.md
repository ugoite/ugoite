# SQL Sessions & Materialized Views

**Updated**: 2026-02

This document defines how Ugoite manages SQL execution without persisting
large result sets. The design is **stateless except for OpenDAL storage** and
avoids RDBs, external job queues, or NFS-based shared disks.

## Constraints

- **No RDB for session state** (no PostgreSQL/MySQL/etc.).
- **No external job queue** (Celery/Redis/RabbitMQ, etc.).
- **No NFS shared disk**. OpenDAL storage is the only shared persistence.
- **Short-lived sessions** (target: ~10 minutes).
- **Multiple API servers** may serve the same session concurrently.

## Materialized Views

When a saved SQL is created (`create_sql`), a corresponding **materialized view
metadata record** MUST be created under:

```
spaces/{space_id}/materialized_views/{sql_id}/
```

The materialized view lifecycle is **synchronized** with the SQL entry:

- **Create SQL** → create materialized view metadata
- **Update SQL** → refresh/rebuild materialized view metadata
- **Delete SQL** → delete materialized view metadata

Materialized views are currently **metadata-only placeholders**. The on-disk
layout of any future Iceberg-managed tables is owned by Iceberg and will be
specified when materialization is implemented.

When SQL references Forms with explicit read/write ACL metadata, materialized
view metadata MUST inherit effective policy from source Forms. Access checks on
materialized view reads MUST be equivalent to the source Forms.

### Materialized View Metadata (Optional)

A lightweight metadata file may be stored at:

```
spaces/{space_id}/materialized_views/{sql_id}/meta.json
```

Recommended fields:

```json
{
  "sql_id": "sql-uuid",
  "sql": "SELECT * FROM Meeting",
  "source_forms": ["Meeting"],
  "access_policy": {
    "inherit_from_forms": true,
    "mode": "intersection"
  },
  "created_at": "2026-02-10T12:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-02-10T12:05:00Z",
  "snapshot_id": 42,
  "schema_hash": "sha256:..."
}
```

## SQL Sessions (Metadata Only)

SQL sessions store **metadata only** at:

```
spaces/{space_id}/sql_sessions/{session_id}/meta.json
```

Sessions do **not** store result rows. Every query for rows/count re-runs the SQL
against the current entries tables; the `view.snapshot_id` field is a logical
marker reserved for future materialized view support.

### Session Metadata Schema (Recommended)

```json
{
  "id": "session-uuid",
  "space_id": "space-uuid",
  "sql_id": "sql-uuid",
  "sql": "SELECT * FROM Meeting ORDER BY updated_at DESC LIMIT 50",
  "status": "ready",
  "created_at": "2026-02-10T12:00:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2026-02-10T12:10:00Z",
  "error": null,
  "view": {
    "sql_id": "sql-uuid",
    "snapshot_id": 42,
    "snapshot_at": "2026-02-10T12:00:00Z",
    "schema_version": 1
  },
  "pagination": {
    "strategy": "offset",
    "order_by": ["updated_at", "id"],
    "default_limit": 50,
    "max_limit": 1000
  },
  "count": {
    "mode": "on_demand",
    "cached_at": null,
    "value": null
  }
}
```

### Paging & Count

- **Rows**: `offset`/`limit` is applied to the re-executed query against the
  current entries tables.
- **Count**: computed on-demand with `SELECT COUNT(*)` against the same query.
- **Fast paging**: `order_by` in metadata MUST include a deterministic tie-breaker
  (e.g., `id`) to avoid unstable pages.

### Expiration & Cleanup

Sessions are short-lived. Implementations SHOULD delete expired session metadata
on a periodic sweep or when accessed after `expires_at`.

## Multi-Server Behavior

Because the only persistence is OpenDAL storage, **any API server** can service
requests for the same session by reading `meta.json`, then re-running the SQL
query against the current entries tables.
