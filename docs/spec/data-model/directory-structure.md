## Root Level

### `hmac.json`

Root response-signing key material:

```json
{
  "hmac_key_id": "key-2025-11-01",
  "hmac_key": "base64-encoded-secret",
  "last_rotation": "2025-11-15T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Space Level

### `meta.json`

```json

}
```

## Form Tables (Iceberg)

### `forms/`

All form storage is managed by Apache Iceberg using the official Rust crate with
OpenDAL-backed IO. The filesystem layout **beneath this directory** is owned by
Iceberg and is intentionally not specified here. Each Form is represented as an
Iceberg namespace named by the Form name. Each Form namespace contains its own
`entries` and `revisions` tables (there is no shared cross-Form table).

**Template convention (global):**
```
# {form_name}

## {column_1}
## {column_2}
...
```
The template is fixed across the service; Form-specific templates are not stored
outside Iceberg.

**Required tables (logical names):**
- `entries` (current entry rows)
- `revisions` (revision history rows)

**Required operations:**
- Append new entry rows and update existing entry rows via Iceberg writes.
- Append revision rows for every save.
- Support snapshot/time-travel reads for conflict resolution and history.
- Allow compaction/maintenance via Iceberg without breaking logical access.

### `entries` table (logical schema)

One row per entry. Columns include standard metadata plus **only** the fields
defined by the Iceberg schema for that Form. The Form identity is implied by
the table name.

Example logical schema:

```text
entry_id: string
title: string
tags: list<string>
links: list<struct<id: string, target: string, kind: string>>
created_at: timestamp
updated_at: timestamp
fields: struct<...>
```

### `revisions` table (logical schema)

One row per revision. Stores historical snapshots of Form-defined fields so full
Markdown can be reconstructed deterministically.

Example logical schema:

```text
revision_id: string
entry_id: string
parent_revision_id: string
timestamp: timestamp
author: string
fields: struct<...>
markdown_checksum: string
```

## Portability

Each space directory is fully portable:
- Copy to another location to backup
- Move to different storage backend
- Share with other Ugoite instances

Materialized indexes (search, embeddings) are derived from Iceberg tables and can be regenerated.

## SQL Materialized Views (Metadata)

### `materialized_views/`

Saved SQL entries create a corresponding materialized view **metadata** record
under `materialized_views/`. The metadata is created on SQL creation, refreshed
on SQL update, and deleted on SQL deletion. The on-disk layout for future
Iceberg-managed views is intentionally not specified.

## SQL Sessions (Metadata Only)

SQL sessions persist **only metadata** to allow re-running queries against the
current entries tables. Result rows are never stored under `sql_sessions/`.
